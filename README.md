UnityAnimationHotkeyExtension
=============================

This script adds some simple missing hotkeys to the Animation window in Unity.

Installation
------------
Create an Editor folder in a location of your choice in your Project view and place AnimationWindowHotkeys.cs inside of it.

Hotkeys
-------
P - Play Animation
I - Previous Keyframe
O - Next Keyframe

These can be changed by editting the [MenuItem()] inside AnimationWindowHotkeys.cs
For more information on this, visit the [Unity Documentation](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MenuItem.html)

Note: Because of a bug in the Windows editor, you will have to use Shift+Key to get the hotkeys working.
